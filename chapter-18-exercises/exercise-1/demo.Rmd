## This is my markdown report

l like writing **reports** 

This is the code we will look at in class. Thisis just plain old Markdown that lets you rendertext in **bold** or _italics_. However, you canput in a block of R code, and the document willshow the code and the results!

``` {r example, echo= FALSE}
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)

```

The mean of the numbers

```{r other_chunk , echo= FALSE}
print(numbers)
```
